      <p class="text-box" data-section="Folding" data-value="p1">The inputs to the system are the button that initiates the system sequence and the limit sensors to know that the 2-bar mechanisms have completed their trajectory. The 4 mechanisms are actuated by DC motors with gearbox and are controlled through a driver designed in Proteus Design Suite. The PIC16F877a microcontroller was used as the processing center.</p>
